# thrift.vim #

A thrift syntax file for vim. This is taken from the official repository for
Apache Thrift, however I have improved it so that it doesn't require any
modifications to your vimrc to set the filetype.

## Installation ##

Use your usual plugin manager. I recommend [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
    ```NeoBundle 'solarnz/thrift.vim'```
